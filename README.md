# Hackthissite Programming Missions Level 1

</br>

## My python script solution to Hackthissite's programming mission 1  

</br> 

</br>
Taken from their site's 'About Project' page - 
"Hack This Site is a free training ground for users to test and expand their hacking skills. 
Our community is dedicated to facilitating an open learning environment by providing a series of hacking challenges, articles, resources,
and discussion of the latest happenings in hacker culture. We are an online movement of artists, activists, hackers and anarchists who are 
organizing to create new worlds. "

Hackthissite has several different categories of missions to complete.  
In this particulare mission, you land on a page containing a link to a word list file, a list of scrambled words, a form to submit the requested info
and the directions of what you must accomplish.
The list of scrambled given words are located in their natural form somewhere within the wordlist.txt file.
You must unscramble the words and submit the readable list in the same order. If it is correct you pass the level.
You have 30 seconds to perform this once you land on the page.

To complete this level, I wrote the python script in main.py, then placed the wordlist in a .txt file and created another file, left empty, named 'paste.txt', all in the same folder.
The script will run the scrambled words in paste.txt one by one against wordlist.txt until it finds it's unscrambled match and moves through the list until complete. 
When ready, open the mission page where the clock begins. Quickly copy the scrambled word list provided, paste it into the empty file('paste.txt'),
run the program, copy the output, paste the output into the level's text field and click submit. Mission Accomplished!
